# Srum
## Sprint 
* A Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and
potentially releasable product Increment is created. 
* Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. 
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

At *Grey Rook* the time-box of a Sprint is always 2 weeks (starting on Monday and 
ending on Friday the following week).

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* The scope stays the same but issues can be exchanged

The Sprint Goal is to increase the velocity (done issues in a Sprint) under the 
condition that the quality does not suffer. In order to assure that the velocity
increases, the scope of the Sprint needs to stay the same. At *Grey Rook* we aim 
to plan the Spint so that no issues need to be changed. However, as it is an agile 
process, there are always circumstances that demand for a quick change. That can be 
hotfixes and breaking bugs als well as presentations for clients that need adjustments 
in the code. Issues can be exchanged at any point in the Sprint process given the 
following conditions:

* It is feasible to complete the new issue within the Sprint
* The new issue has the same Story Points (given that issues can only replace
issues and bugs only bugs)
* It is discussed with at least one othe member of the Development Team
* The client is informed about the change and agrees

### Sprint Planning
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the *Sprint Planning*. 
This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for two-week Sprint. 
The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants 
understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it 
within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
