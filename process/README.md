# Srum
## Sprint 
* A Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and
potentially releasable product Increment is created. 
* Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. 
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* the scope stays the same but issues can be exchanged

### Sprint Planning
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the *Sprint Planning*. 
This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for two-week Sprint. 
The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants 
understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it 
within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
