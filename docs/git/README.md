# Git Guidelines

## Branch naming

We always branch from master and create a branch with the naming pattern:

```
<PROJECT-HANDLE>-<TICKET-NUMBER>-<DASH-SEPERATED-SHORT-DESCRIPTION-OF-BRANCH-CONTENT>
```
e.g.
```
STUD-42-the-answer-to-everything
```

There should always be at least be one branch per ticket (Story/Bug Report/Subtask) added with this naming structure. Branches which build on each other should have the same project handle and ticket number in the branch name.
The description part can vary.
