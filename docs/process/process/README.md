The aim of the agile approach of Scrum is transprency regarding the issues that need to be done in a certain time frame. 
Thus, a Sprint (2 weeks) is planned with an amount of issues that the Development Team is certain to accomplish.
The issues follow a strict workflow in Jira, so that the Develpmemt Team and the Scrum owner see at any moment of the Sprint the status of an issue.
There is the rule that a developer can only work on one issue at a time i.e. can only have one issue with the status "in Arbeit".
There can be reasons that hinder the developer to complete an issue. If such a case happens, the developer is obliged to move or delegate the ticket and write a comment into the issue to explain it to the other developers. 
Only if there is a comment, the developer can chose a new issue to work on.
