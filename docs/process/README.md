# Srum
## Sprint 
* A Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and
potentially releasable product Increment is created. 
* Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. 
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

At *Grey Rook* the time-box of a Sprint is always 2 weeks (starting on Monday and 
ending on Friday the following week).

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made to the Sprint that would endanger the Sprint goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* The scope stays the same but issues can be exchanged

The Sprint Goal is to increase the velocity (done issues in a Sprint) under the 
condition that the quality does not suffer. In order to assure that the velocity
increases, the scope of the Sprint needs to stay the same. At *Grey Rook* we aim 
to plan the Sprint so that no issues need to be changed. However, as it is an agile 
process, there are always circumstances that demand for a quick change. That can be 
hotfixes and breaking bugs as well as presentations for clients that need adjustments 
in the code. Issues can be exchanged at any point in the Sprint process given the 
following conditions:

* It is feasible to complete the new issue within the Sprint
* The new issue has the same amount of Story Points (given that issues can only replace
issues and bugs only bugs)
* It is discussed with at least one of the members of the Development Team
* The client is informed about the change and agrees

### Sprint Planning
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the *Sprint Planning*. 
This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for two-week Sprint. 
The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants 
understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it 
within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

# Story Points
1. A measure of team output
* Correlated to but not necessarily the same as effort
* Describes the complexity of a requirement
2. A relative measure 
* Measured relative to a known “reference” story
* Consistent over time for the same team
* Not necessarily comparable across teams
* Deliberately abstracted from common units of measurement 
(hours, meters, kilograms, etc.)
* Physical measures come with emotional baggage
* Quick to use, once you have established a reference story 
3. Based on the Fibonacci Sequence 
* That is a pattern where the next number in the sequence is the sum 
of the previous two
* i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55…
* Ubiquitous in natural systems, so humans have millennia of experience with it
* The sequence is effective in estimation because the sum of the quantities of 
the larger number is equal to the ratio of the larger number to the smaller one

Story Points are given in the planning phase of a Sprint.  
At **Grey Rook** we use numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.  
If a developer thinks it takes more time to discuss a ticket than to actually resolve it, he should give the ticket a 0.  
Tickets can also have 4,6,7 or 10 Story Points, due to the fact that in an estimate session the average of the estimate of the Development Team is generated. 
Moreover, in order to reach consensus when the estimates are very different, the developer with the highest and the lowest estimate have to explain their reasons for their estimate. All members of the Development Team have the right to change their original estimate after this discussion.  
Given this process there should not be any story ticket inside a sprint without an estimation. User stories without an estimation are not allowed to be worked on.    
Bug tickets on the other hand do not get story points.

**Summary:** *A Story Point is a relative unit of measure, decided upon and used by individual Scrum teams, to provide relative estimates of effort for completing requirements*
